# Notes to Future Self
- Don't introduce IntelliJ/Eclipse until after inheritance lectures/labs

# TODO
- There's too many homework assignments. Go back to 7 and give everyone a break in between.
- Get rid of bin-search from Big-O, but add selection sort, replacing doTask algos.
- How to shorten the first 3 weeks? (Can't get rid of exceptions, can I.)
- But do something about exceptions. It's just not clear when to throw/catch.
  - Maybe need a better lab?
- Get assignment starter code on github
