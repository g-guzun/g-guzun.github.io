## CS 161 - Intro to Computer Science

### Final Homework Proposal

For your final assignment, you may choose between a pre-made assignment (Black Jack) or you can pitch your own idea. If you decide to pitch your own (which I encourage), it must have the following attributes:

- A main method that accepts user input (if appropriate) and runs your program.
- Use of at least one collection: arrays (1D, 2D, etc.), ArrayList, HashMap, or Set.
- If appropriate, your program might input data from a file.
- Use of constants wherever possible.
- You are allowed to use APIs and libraries that we have not learned, and you're also allowed to use APIs and libraries that are written by others, so as long as they are credited in your software.
- Your program should observe good modularity. Break your program down into classes as appropriate, with methods that demonstrate good interoperability between objects.

#### Project Ideas

Here are the cool project ideas from years past. You're certainly welcome to reuse any of these ideas (or just work on BlackJack), but you're encouraged to be creative. Don't talk yourself out of doing something because it doesn't feel possible. You have access to me and the tutors (and the Internet) to learn new tricks. For non-CS majors, I strongly encourage you to think creatively about a project that might be useful to your major. Brainstorm, and even ask your professors for data to process, if appropriate!

Here's a short list of what CS 161 students have done in the last couple years:

- _Hangman:_ The game inputs a file containing all known English words (you can find this in a lot of places on the Internet), and the game selects a random word out of that file. The letters in the secret word are initially concealed by "dashes." As users input letters to guess, they either get a "hit," revealing the letters in the correct spot, or they get a "miss," which adds a body part to the hangman. Once hangman is drawn, and the word has not been guessed, the user loses and the word is revealed.

- _Hiking Database and Guide:_ A program stores various hike data in a file for Washington State. It starts by asking the user what scenes they want to see on a hike (waterfalls, mountains, wildflowers, etc.) Then it asks for the user's preferred difficulty level, and length. Given these inputs, the program outputs all the hikes matching the user's criteria.

- _Music Player:_ A program that catalogs your MP3 files. You can print a list of all of them on your computer (presumably, all your MP3s are in a single folder). You can organize them in terms of genre, artist, title, etc. Once the user selects the file they want to play (by inputting its filename), you can use an external library to play those an MP3 file.

- _Tamagotchi:_ A program that simulates a flower or animal that you must care for over time. The entity grows and becomes happy/unhappy depending on the frequency and type of your interactions. One challenge is getting the program to recognize how long it has been (in real time) since your last interaction with the entity.

- _Mood Guesser:_ A program that utilizes an external API that can tell you the sentiment value for a given word (Ask me for it, and I can provide). For instance, the score for a positive word, like "happy" or "awesome" would be closer to 1.0. A negative word like "angry" or "unfair" would have a sentiment score closer to -1.0. Using a library that can do this, you try to guess the mood of someone writing a tweet.

<!-- - _A Graphical BlackJack:_ One student programmed BlackJack, and then wrote a graphical interface for it (think Life lab). A black jack table is drawn on the canvas, hit and hold and quit buttons are implemented -->

#### Proposal

If you want to pitch your idea, all I would need is a short document that summarizes your project, why it's interesting to you, and the classes and data structures you plan to use. Most importantly, this project is graded out of 100 points, so you need to provide a rubric for me to use to grade the success of your project. Submit the proposal on Canvas when you're ready. If I have concerns, I will contact you.

#### Grading

This assignment will be graded out of a total of 100 pts. It is your job to provide a rubric for me to use to measure the success of your project.

#### Submitting Your Assignment

Submit a text file containing your project idea and rubric on Canvas.
