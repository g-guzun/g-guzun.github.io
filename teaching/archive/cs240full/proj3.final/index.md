## CS 240 - Software Engineering

### Project 3: Reflection and Final Presentation

#### Student Outcomes

- To communicate orally through a project demonstration.
- To reflect on your own contributions and evaluate others.

#### Wrapping up

The end is near, and now it's time to show off what you'd been working on to all of us. At this point I ask that you wrap up any remaining features and don't start anything new. Systematically test your software in various ways, and fix any bugs so that it's in "camera-ready" shape. Commit and push the final version of your code to Github (include your test code).

#### Project Demonstration

Be prepared by the day of the final to give a 15-20 minute demo presentation to the class on your project, allowing a few minutes for question and answer. The format of the presentation is free-form -- meaning it's really up to you to decide how to organize it. For instance, slides are not at all necessary, but could be useful to organize your thoughts.

The demo should showcase the core functionalities of your software prototype, and every team member must have equal participation in the demo (you will be graded on balance). The demo should be organized, which means you should prepare a "script," with fluid transitions from one presenter to another. It is recommended that you do a couple practice-runs to iron out all the wrinkles before the class demo. The demo does count for a significant portion of your final grade.

At the minimum, your demo should outline:

- Explanation for your project. Why it's needed (in a simulated world) and whom it's for.
- Spend time showing off and discussing persona, scenarios, and major features.
- Lessons learned ("If we could do it over, we would ...")
- The most important takeaway was ...

Some other topics you might discuss:

- If we had more time, we'd ...
- What worked well, and what didn't?
- How might you change the way you code after taking this class?

#### Submissions

Please submit to me the following:

1. Make sure any slides, final code base, including test suite, are pushed to Github.
2. On canvas, provide me with a link to your github project page and a link to your team's Trello workspace.

<!-- #### Grading

```
The demo will be graded out of 10 points:
[10pt] The in-class demo/presentation is well-prepared, fluid, and organized.


[10pt] Peer evaluation. All other teams will evaluate the quality of your project.
[25pt] Internal/self evaluation. Each of your teammates will evaluate your contributions to the overall project.

Misc.
[-5pt] Failure to turn in a peer evaluation. (Both demo days)
[-5pt] Failure to turn in an internal evaluation. (Final Exam)
