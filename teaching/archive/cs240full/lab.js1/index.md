## CS 240 - Software Engineering

### In-Class Exercise: JavaScript Basics 1 (~20min)

In this exercise you will learn how to set up a project in your VS code environment from scratch. You will also practice writing some basic JavaScript functions.

#### Student Outcomes

- Learn how to set up and run JS code
- Learn how to use basic JavaScript elements

#### Setting up the VS Code Environment

- There are a few VS Code extensions I find to be super useful for development. Let's go ahead and install them now.

  - Click on the extensions button to the left-hand panel. It looks like ![](extensions-view-icon.png)
  - Now find and install each of the following extensions (some may require you to restart VS Code before it's active)
    - `Live Server` (this is a must) by Ritwick Dey. You should restart VS Code after installing it.
    - `Prettier Code Formatter`
    - `Bracket Pair Colorizer`
    - `Color Highlight`
    - `Mithril Emmet`

- After installing those extensions, there are a few more things we could configure to make your lives easier:

  - Go into VS Code's `Preferences -> Settings`. In the search bar on top, search for `format on save`. Make sure the option is enabled.
  <!-- - In .js and .html files, cmd+shift+p => Type "format", then choose "Prettier" extension -->

- Create a new project directory in VS Code, called `cs240-lab-js1`. We'll work inside this directory for this lab.

- Create an `index.html` file. In the empty file, if you type `!`, the "Mithril Emmet" extension should pop up, asking if you want to fill the file with a boilerplate. Go ahead and do it.

- In the `<body>` tag, add a `<script></script>` element to link to a JavaScript (we haven't created it yet) called `app.js`. (You might have to do some googling to figure out how to do it with the `<script>` tag)

- To run/view your file, right click on `index.html` and choose `Start Live Server...` This should open your browser to your `index.html` file. Right click anywhere on the page and choose `Inspect`. In the panel that opens up, choose the `Console` tab to see any outputs generated by your `app.js` file --- which we still haven't created. Let's change that.

- Now go back in VSCode to create a new file, `app.js`.

  - Create an array called `animals` that's initially empty. Use a while loop to continuously `prompt(...)` the user for a new animal, until `quit` is entered by the user. Add each of the animals to `head` of your `animals` array. For instance, if the user successively enters "goat", "pig", "turtle", then your array should contain `["turtle", "pig", "goat"]`.

  - Now print the contents of the array in lexicographical (alphabetical, in this case) order.

- If you have time, or just want more practice, work on the following:
  - Normalize all the animals so that the first letter is capitalized, and the rest are lower case, before sorting and printing.
  - Ensure that the same animal can't be entered twice.
