# TODO
- Incorporate the laptop into all SQL courses and have them follow along and give them small group work.
  - Use lab time to work on homework 4 and move up deadline of Hwk 4.
- Move exam 1 up a week? Too much going on for students that week though...
- I should really think about the first two days. Just talk about problems and move on to sets.
- There's a lot (too much?) exam 1 practice, between the labs, Hwk, and RGs. How to better balance?
- Redo the study guides so that the topics are listed
- Hwk 6: The .jar file isn't working for anyone.
- Still not doing a good enough job explaining what the 3rd property of 3NF does to include the Dep-preserving relations. Work out a proof using cover Fc

# Change Log
