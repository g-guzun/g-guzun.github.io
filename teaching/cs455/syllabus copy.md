## CS 455 Syllabus


#### Course Description
The management of data is one of the classical problems in computing. This course centers around the fundamental concepts and theory behind the relational data model, which addresses numerous problems that plague data management, including data independence, access, consistency, and information loss. Course topics include the relational data model, database languages (e.g., SQL), relational database theory, database design (by decomposition), query execution, and considerations that affect system performance. Students will design database schemas that effectively model an organization's information and write applications that require database integration. Students will also gain insight through the implementation of influential data structures and algorithms that are commonly used in modern relational database systems.

#### Prerequisites
A grade of C- or higher in the following course is required, or with permission from the instructor:
- CSCI 261: Computer Science II
- MATH 210: The Mathematics of Computer Science

#### Required Textbook
[Silberschatz, Korth, and Sudarshan, Database System Concepts. 7th Ed.](https://www.amazon.com/Database-Concepts-Sudarshan-Abraham-Silberschatz/dp/B0B8528T3H/)


#### Course Topics
- The Relational Model
- Relational Algebra and SQL
- Relational Database Theory and Normalization
- Performance Analysis
- Database File Organization
- Hashing and Indexing
- Transactions and Concurrency Control



#### Student Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Analyze user requirements to prepare an appropriate relational database schema.
- Use normal forms and perform normalization in the design of a relational database.
- Analyze and solve problems related to external memory data structures and algorithms using suitable mathematics.
- Evaluate the merits among various file organization and indexing designs, with respect to space and time complexity.
- Design, code, test and debug programs which perform query and update transactions on a database in a team-based environment.

#### Grades
Your overall grade is broken down as as follows:

|   | % Weight |
| :--- | :--- |
| Participation | 3% |
| Term Project | 17% |
| Homework Assignments | 30% |
| Midterm I | 15% |
| Midterm II | 15% |
| Final Exam | 20% |



##### Homework Assignments
Homework assignments are a mix of paper-based and coding-based. They account for a significant portion of the final grade.  Unless otherwise noted, you are to work on homework assignments alone. You are welcome to brainstorm with others (including tutors) for ideas, but any code you submit should be yours.

**Do not copy code you find on the web and/or ChatGPT.** This is considered plagiarism. Please see the "Academic Integrity" section below.

##### Homework Late Penalty and Extensions
For each day that an assignment is late (including weekends), a $$3^d\%$$ deduction, where $$d$$ is the number of days late, will be assessed. Because ample amounts of time are provided to complete each assignment (usually around 1-2 weeks) no extensions be will given for homework assignments, unless you are experiencing unique circumstances or for accommodations.

##### Term Project
There will be an open-ended group project assigned about mid-way through the course. The most successful teams meet and physically work together at an agreed-upon location and time -- that is, *uno animo*. It is a good idea to set up version control environments and practice scrum, to ensure everyone has something to do and is making progress. A final presentation will be given in the last week of classes (prior to finals week). Each member of the team should contribute equally to the assignment, and every student in a team will receive the same grade.



##### Exams
There will be two midterms and a final exam. They will cover topics discussed in the lectures, readings from the assigned textbook, and assignments. The exams are cumulative. Study guides are provided and selected problems are reviewed on the lecture preceding the day of the exam. You are allowed a page of notes (front and back) on all exams. 

- Make-up: I expect you to be present on the day of exams. I do not offer make-up exams unless you can demonstrate documented extenuating circumstances. (These do not count as extenuating circumstances: experiencing a cold, overslept, family visiting, etc.)

- Accommodations: It is *your* responsibility to inform me if you will be taking it at SAA well-ahead of time, so that I have time to get the exams over to their office.

- The following items are prohibited on the day of exams: Graphing calculators, phones, headphones, and other mobile devices.


##### Attendance and Participation
Regular attendance and participation are required. Attendance, to be graded out of 10 points, applies towards your final grade. I deduct **2 points** for each unexcused absence, **1 point** for being late, and **1 point** for engaging in activities that can disrupt others: scrolling through your phone, texting, playing games on your laptop, etc.

##### Final Letter Grades
These are the cutoffs when assigning your final letter grades. Please note that decimals are ignored (e.g., 89.99% = B+). The cutoffs below might come down, but will not be set higher.

| Final Average  | Letter Grade |
| :--- | :--- |
| 100% - 95% | A |
| 94% - 90% | A- |
| 89% - 87% | B+ |
| 86% - 83% | B |
| 82% - 80% | B- |
| 79% - 77% | C+ |
| 76% - 73% | C |
| 72% - 70% | C- |
| 69% - 67% | D+ |
| 66% - 63% | D |
| 62% - 60% | D- |
| 59% and below | F |

##### No Laptops, No Phones
Laptop computers and other handheld devices are a common distraction during lectures. Except on lab days and for those who can provide documentation of need from the office of SAA, please don't bring your laptops to lectures. Please turn your phones off, or at least put your phones on silent during lecture.


#### University, Academic, and Administrative Policies
There are many university policies and resources that offer guidance on how to be safe and make the most of your college education. Here are a few that you should take a moment to review:
