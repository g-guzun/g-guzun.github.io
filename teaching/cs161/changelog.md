#### TODO
- I should do a small unit on debugging and hand out rubber ducks sooner. BlueJ debugger tool. Problems like reverse(), edge cases, removing items from a list, ...
  - I'd have to cut hashmap. Not a huge deal if I do.
- Need one more nested loop array problem in Hwk 6. Not a super challenging one though.
- Consider doing exams on Fridays instead of Thursdays to preserve Lab? What about TA hours?
- Hwk 1 can be due 2 days earlier now.
- Why have students create a new zip every time? Just submit the `.java` files.
- Move static/enum/private/public up (or spread them out)
- Start teaching `if (5 == x)` instead of `(x == 5)`. A debugging lab?
- Hwk 4 lot cooler if I introduced an Arm class or somethingâ€¦
