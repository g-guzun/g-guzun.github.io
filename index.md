Gheorghi Guzun has been a faculty member in the Department of <a href="https://sjsu.edu/cmpe">Computer Engineering at San Jose State University</a> since 2017. 
</p>
  <p>
Gheorghi obtained his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Iowa being guided and supervised by <a href="https://engineering.uiowa.edu/people/guadalupe-canahuate">Guadalupe Canahuate</a>. His Ph.D. work was in the area of data mining and large-scale distributed data systems, with a focus on indexing technologies for fast query processing.  
His current research interests are at the intersection of data management and machine learning, and include topics such as, algorithm optimization for machine learning, energy efficiency in data intensive applications, data compression and quantization, large-scale indexing, data analysis and exploration. Many of the research projects are focused on scalability and performance of large data management systems, with a special interest in hardware-driven software design for data analytics, machine learning, and distributed systems. Our work has addressed critical applications such as improving compute infrastructure monitoring systems, energy efficient data centers, and fast modeling of possible flood events to improve intervention response times. Dr. Guzun is a recipient of the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2238291">CAREER</a> award from the National Science Foundation.
