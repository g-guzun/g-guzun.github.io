### Student FAQs

- **I want to leave the department anonymous feedback.**\
  Comments on an instructor's pedagogical choices or teaching style that are specific to a particular course are perhaps best expressed on the end-of-semester Student Evaluation Forms. Academic concerns such as suggestions for course offerings or requests for academic accommodation should be discussed with your advisor instead.

  For other concerns, I direct you to use our [anonymous feedback form](https://forms.gle/Ltassc7BQkNfnnXB7). The purpose of this form is for Puget Sound students to provide feedback (both positive and negative) to the CS department, which among others topics, may include anything related to:

    1. Student culture and community
    2. Student academic experience
    3. Classroom environment and management
    4. Tutoring
    5. Faculty-student interaction

- **I'm waitlisted for your course. Can you let me in?**\
  I treat these requests on a case-by-case basis. Things I consider include: your position on the wait list, whether there are alternative sections with space, and whether you need my course to graduate.

- **What are your office hours?**\
  Check canvas for standard office hours, and I also keep an open-door policy. As long as my door is cracked, I'm available. The calendar on my home page gives a rough outline of my day-to-day availability. If you'd like to set up a specific time to meet, however, you're welcome to email me.

- **Will you be my advisor?**\
  Well, "advisor" means different things to different people, so let's clarify.

  - As an **academic advisor**, I would be formally associated with you in the university system. This gives me access to your transcripts, and it would allow me to view and submit alerts. It'd be my job to navigate you through our curriculum and to deliver you to a successful graduation and, if you deserve it, help advocate for you when positions open up. I generally agree if asked to serve. However, there are also circumstances that may prevent me from serving, e.g., if I'm on leave or if my current advising load is too high (that is, it's never personal if I must decline).

  - As a **mentor**, I will give non-judgmental advice about current academics, work, life, graduate school/job outlook. We might look over your resume, or do a mock interview, etc. I try to keep you in mind when I learn about opportunities that might be a good fit for you. There is no official method to ask for mentoring. The mentor-mentee relationship usually develops organically.

- **How do I do summer research with you?**\
  If I have a project (usually in Databases) that is available, and I think that you would be a good fit, I will reach out to you to gauge your interest. But just because you don't hear from me doesn't mean you can't reach out! I'm demanding, but I'll ensure that you're ready for the work. I will train you so that you have the necessary background in my area, and on how to "science." Such "sciencing" activities include: how to express problem statements and hypotheses, how to design and run experiments, how to communicate your results effectively, how to structure a technical paper.

- **Can we talk about grad school?**\
  Yes, make an appointment with me. And the earlier the better. We should be having this conversation ideally when you're in your 3rd year. I'll be happy to set up an appointment. The Math/CS faculty also run a grad school panel every year year in Fall, so watch out for the announcements in your email.

- **Can you write me a letter of recommendation?**\
  The impact of a letter begins with the reliability of its writer, so I don't write puff pieces because I happen to like you. Know that I _will_ list your weaknesses along with strengths. If I agree to write your letter, I would tell you any weaknesses I'd list (if any), and let you decide if you still want me to proceed. Know that good grades in isolation don't really impress me (nor many readers of the letter). "A" students are everywhere, and there's always someone with a better record than you. So you need to ask yourself, _"What separates me from the rest?"_ What impresses people in addition to good grades are your attitudes, actions, and how you treat others.

  - _"Is David a relevant judge?"_ Try to gauge how much I'd know about your current strengths and weaknesses for the position to which you are applying. Just because you got a good grade in my CS 1 or CS 2 class doesn't mean I would know anything about your qualifications for graduate school or a job as a software developer.

  - _"Have I been a good citizen in the department?"_ Good grades are not sufficient for me to write you a decent letter. How do you treat people? Are you easy to work with? If you've demonstrated any immaturity, rudeness, or inappropriateness in my classroom or in general, don't bother asking me for a letter.

  - _"Am I giving David enough time?"_ Though it's not always possible, I usually ask that you give me 3+ weeks heads-up. You wouldn't want me to rush a letter out the door. The letter may be less polished, and I may forget to put down certain facts or interactions with you that could've strengthened the letter.

  - _"Have I provided David with enough information?"_ Have you provided me with a current resume or CV? Do you have a description of the position? How about a draft cover letter declaring your interests and qualifications? Until you can provide these items, you aren't ready to ask for letters!

  - _"How long has it been since I last interacted with David?"_ If it's been multiple years since you graduated, I may not remember enough details about you as a student. I'd likely have to rely on data like grades and GPA, which may no longer represent you.

  - If you believe that David is qualified, please fill out this [request form](https://forms.gle/vyHiYT8RH8ehTihA7).

- **Can I list you for a job reference?**\
  I am generally fine with this, as long as I've had you in my courses. You're reminded that I'm honest about my evaluations of students, so a lot of the things from the previous question still apply.

- **Can we connect on social media?**\
  I'm happy to connect with students and alumni on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidtchiu). There is also a [CS department group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/1864577/) on LinkedIn that you should request to join, and a [Math/CS Department Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ups_mathcs/) that you can follow.
